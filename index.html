        <p class="paractr">A former collegiate baseball player in the 1980s myself, <br>
        only one athlete did I ever present to my son as a person <br>
        he might enjoy learning about. That athlete was... <br><br><br>
        <strong>Herschel Walker</strong>

      <div id="myfaveq"><strong>My favorite quote:</strong></div>
        <p class="paractr"><em>"My parents didn't have a lot of money. My school didn't have <br>
          a lot of money, but I didn't use that as an excuse. <br><br>
          So, I started doing pushups and situps during commercials as I was <br>
          watching TV, started doing sometimes <strong>2,000 pushups</strong>, <strong>3,000 situps</strong>, <br>
        <strong>1,500 pullups</strong>, or <strong>1,000 dips</strong>... different things like that. <br>
          I started creating different hand positions for all that, <br>
          <strong>then I learned that that could work you out!</strong><br><br>
